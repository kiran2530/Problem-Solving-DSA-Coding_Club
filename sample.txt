    Q)  Given an array of N elements, where each element is at most K away from its target position, 
        devise an algorithm that sorts in O(N log K).

    Examples : 
        Input   : arr[] = {6,5,3,2,8,10,9} , K = 3
        Output  : arr[] = {2,3,5,6,8,9,10}

        Input   : arr[] = {10,9,8,7,4,70,60,50} , K = 4
        Output  : arr[] = {4,7,8,9,10,50,60,70}
